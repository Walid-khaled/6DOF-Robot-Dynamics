## 6DOF-Robot-Dynamics
In this repository, trajectory planning for a 6DOF manipulator is implemented. Synchronization and numerical control are applied. In addition, propagated error in end-effector position is calculated. Finally, ploynomial trajectory and trajectory junction are solved. The repository is also a solution for Assignment3 in Dynamics of Nonlinear Robotics Systems course for ROCV master's program at Innopolis University.
